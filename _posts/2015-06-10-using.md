Before using any of the Athena tools, you will need to install a few dependencies.
After installing these, you can download precompiled binaries from the releases
section on GitHub for the tool you are looking for, or through crates.io if you
want to use an Athena library.


### Rust

Athena is built on Rust, a fast and safe systems programming language. Some Athena
tools need to compile Rust code at runtime, so you will need to install the Rust
compiler.

You can install Rust by going to the [Rust download page](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html)
and installing **Rust Nightly 32 bit**. Currently, not all projects will work on
stable or 64 bit.


### Git

Zeus requries Git to pull in tool dependencies. A typical 32-bit git install will
be picked up by Zeus automatically. You can find the [Git download page here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).


### Native Dependencies (Phosphorus Only)

Currently, phosphorus requires the native dependencies to be installed manually.

Download the Windows *libfreetype-6.dll* and *zlib1.dll* from the [freetype site](http://www.freetype.org/download.html).
Put these two DLLs together in a folder where you wan to keep your dependencies.

In the Rust project you want to set up the native dependencies for, create a new
folder ".cargo". In this new folder, create a file "config" with the following content:

```toml
[target.i686-pc-windows-gnu.freetype]
rustc-link-search = ["C:/PATH/TO/DEPENDENCIES"]
rustc-link-lib = ["freetype-6"]
root = "C:/PATH/TO/DEPENDENCIES"
```
