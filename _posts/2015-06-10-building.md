Before working with any of the Athena tools, you will need to set up your build
environment.


### Dependencies

Install all the dependencies from the [Using]({% post_url 2015-06-10-using %}) section.
Also install the **Native Dependencies**, even if you are not working with phosphorus.


### Building

Once the build environment is set up, all you have to do to build an Athena tool
from source is:

```
cargo build
```
